# Engagement

## Initial Proposal

The saga began when I was forwarded the RFP for this project by multiple friends in the festival scene.  I put together a proposal and traveled to San Francisco to present it to staff at global HQ.

## Scope Week

The proposal was well-received, but multiple staffers were concerned that my fixed bid underestimated the true scope of the project.  To address this, I spent a week at global HQ, interviewing two dozen different staffers in order to learn as much about the work needed.

When I finished, it was clear that my original proposal needed to be revised.  I presented a new proposal for an open-ended engagement on a time-and-materials basis.

# Research

## Narrative Request

The scope week interviews gave me a great understanding of the processes and culture involved -- but only from the perspective of the staff at global HQ.  Before I started trying to find or build solutions, it seemed important to get some additional perspectives.  In the metaphor of [the Blind Men and an Elephant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant), I need to grope some more elephant-parts.

I groped by way of the Narrative Request, which was distributed via multiple channels in the Burning Man organization.  The results I got were both informative and inspirational.

## Followup Interviews

There are three groups that stuck out during my initial scoping interviews: Department of Public Works, Gate-Perimeter-Exodus, and the Black Rock Rangers.  Each of those groups has developed extensive internal processes and tools, and it is utterly essential that whatever changes are made do not break what are already well-oiled machines.

So far, I've managed to secure detailed followup interviews with [Logan Mirto (DPW Labor Manager)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/loganmirto/) and [Ira Wing (GPE Manager)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/irawing/).  I'm still trying to secure an interview with [Wilfredo SÃ¡nchez Vega (BRR Manager)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wsanchez/).

## New People's Database Proposal

Over the course of my research, I identified a major problem that the organization faces.  It is currently using dozens of different tools to capture and manage data about participants, and the information in those tools is inaccessible to many people who need it to make decisions.  E.g. someone using Salesforce to learn about a potential donor they are going to contact is unable to see that the donor worked with DPW for six years.  The silod nature of their data also creates data integrity problems with other processes that the organization has.  E.g. when they are printing and mailing thank you cards -- which mailing address should they use for any given participant?  The one in Salesforce?  The one in Ranger's Secret Clubhouse?  These errors cost the organization both in quality (mis-mailed thank you cards) and energy (trying to manually solve discrepancies).

I proposed creating a system that provides visibility across any web-based tool that the organization has, and I called it the "New People's Database" as a nod to the old "People's Database" that supported the organization's growth in previous years.

The response to this proposal was that the organization did not want to proceed with this until the beginning of 2018.  Until then, I was directed to work on several research projects.
