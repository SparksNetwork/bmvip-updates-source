# Engagement

## Initial Proposal

The saga began when I was forwarded the RFP for this project by multiple friends in the festival scene.  I put together a proposal and traveled to San Francisco to present it to staff at global HQ.

## Scope Week

The proposal was well-received, but multiple staffers were concerned that my fixed bid underestimated the true scope of the project.  To address this, I spent a week at global HQ, interviewing two dozen different staffers in order to learn as much about the work needed.

When I finished, it was clear that my original proposal needed to be revised.  I presented a new proposal for an open-ended engagement on a time-and-materials basis.

# Research

## Narrative Request

The scope week interviews gave me a great understanding of the processes and culture involved -- but only from the perspective of the staff at global HQ.  Before I started trying to find or build solutions, it seemed important to get some additional perspectives.  In the metaphor of [the Blind Men and an Elephant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant), I need to grope some more elephant-parts.

I groped by way of the Narrative Request, which was distributed via multiple channels in the Burning Man organization.  The results I got were both informative and inspirational.
