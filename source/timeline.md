# Engagement

## Initial Proposal

The saga began when I was forwarded the RFP for this project by multiple friends in the festival scene.  I put together a proposal and traveled to San Francisco to present it to staff at global HQ.

## Scope Week

The proposal was well-received, but multiple staffers were concerned that my fixed bid underestimated the true scope of the project.  To address this, I spent a week at global HQ, interviewing two dozen different staffers in order to learn as much about the work needed.

When I finished, it was clear that my original proposal needed to be revised.  I presented a new proposal for an open-ended engagement on a time-and-materials basis.

# Research

## Narrative Request

The scope week interviews gave me a great understanding of the processes and culture involved -- but only from the perspective of the staff at global HQ.  Before I started trying to find or build solutions, it seemed important to get some additional perspectives.  In the metaphor of [the Blind Men and an Elephant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant), I need to grope some more elephant-parts.

I groped by way of the Narrative Request, which was distributed via multiple channels in the Burning Man organization.  The results I got were both informative and inspirational.

## Followup Interviews

There are three groups that stuck out during my initial scoping interviews: Department of Public Works, Gate-Perimeter-Exodus, and the Black Rock Rangers.  Each of those groups has developed extensive internal processes and tools, and it is utterly essential that whatever changes are made do not break what are already well-oiled machines.

So far, I've managed to secure detailed followup interviews with [Logan Mirto (DPW Labor Manager)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/loganmirto/) and [Ira Wing (GPE Manager)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/irawing/).  I'm still trying to secure an interview with [Wilfredo SÃ¡nchez Vega (BRR Manager)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wsanchez/).
