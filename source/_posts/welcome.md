When I first read the [ten principles of Burning Man](https://burningman.org/culture/philosophical-center/10-principles/), the one that really spoke to me was [Radical Inclusion](https://journal.burningman.org/tag/radical-inclusion/).  It reasonated heavily with my experiences with [Occupy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_movement) and the earlier [anti-globalisation actions](http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/rage-wage-battle-of-los-angeles-at-dnc-20000815) that I had participated in.

Transparency is a cornerstone of radical inclusion.  This site is intended to be the vehicle for transparency around the Volunteerism Improvement Project that I am working on for The Burning Man Project.

I whipped up this site in a couple hours using [Hexo](http://hexo.io), a static site generator, and a modified MIT-licensed theme from [Johnathan Klughertz](http://www.codeblocq.com/).
